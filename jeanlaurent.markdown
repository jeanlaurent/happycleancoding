My name is Jean-Laurent de Morlhon, I'm 38 years old. I'm dealing with software development on various level for more than 15 years.

I write software for a living and usually help others to write software. This kind of define me as a developper. Some call me consultant, achitect, tech lead, CTO. I'm not a found of title, so please call me developper you'll get a smile on my face in return.

I'm currently employed at [Xebia](http://www.xebia.fr) in France where they entitled me as CTO. I want to change the way software is written, so I built [Xebia Studio](http://studio.xebia.fr). A department within Xebia where we write high quality software in no time with other experienced software lovers. I spent most of my time, helping/coding the various projects in the studio.

I'm an occasional speaker in software conference, I mostly like meeting with people on thoses events so don't be shy, and come say hi.
I strongly believe in open source, as a way of building software but also as a philosophy. I'm involved to various degree into some open source projects. I also pilots some of them, when time permits. And, of course, use them every day.
I'm pretty sure the agile mindset is a way of developing software more reliably and with less pain for everybody.
I'm following the craftsmanship mindset, which helps me write and help other write better code.
